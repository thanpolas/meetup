### Summary

As [Ruby's official site][1] quotes "Ruby is... A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write." In this session we will #inspect Ruby's syntax and basic elements from the prespective of a person who already knows a little bit about programming. We will focus on the basics: syntax, variables, constants, flow control, looping, methods, basic types and a little bit about classes, modules, inheritance and mixins. If there is any time and energy left, we will play with Ruby's Object Model just to get an understanding around the magic that seems to be happening and usually confuses most of the "enterprise" developers.

### About the speaker

Theocharis (Haris) Dimitriou is the head of software development and co-founder of [Polyptychon][2] but really just a developer at heart with a great passion about everything regarding technology. He is an IT specialist with over 14 years of experience in software systems implementations, having built various commercial enterprise systems for health, S.M.E.s, education, industry and culture. After years and years of quests in different programming languages he has finally found peace in Ruby-land where he is not fighting any more with his inherent need to change technologies and programming languages just to be happy...
